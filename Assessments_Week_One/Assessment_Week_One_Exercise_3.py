#Define a class called BankAccount that accepts the name you want associated with your bank account in a string, and an integer that represents the amount of money in the account. The constructor should initialize two instance variables from those inputs: name and amt. Add a string method so that when you print an instance of BankAccount, you see "Your account, [name goes here], has [start_amt goes here] dollars." Create an instance of this class with "Bob" as the name and 100 as the amount. Save this to the variable t1.
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, name, amt):
        self.name = name
        self.amt = amt

    def __str__(self):
        return "Your account, {}, has {} dollars.".format(self.name, self.amt)


t1 = BankAccount(name="Bob", amt=100)
print(t1)
